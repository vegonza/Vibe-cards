# Vibe-Cards

A web-based multiplayer card game "Culo" built with Flask.

## Overview

Vibe-Cards is an implementation of the popular card game "Culo" that allows up to 12 players to play together in real-time. The game features a role system where players can be assigned different roles (President, Vice-President, Neutral, or Culo) based on their performance.

This is a fully vibe-coded project, meaning it was created entirely by AI without writing a single line of code manually. The entire codebase, from backend logic to frontend design, was generated through AI assistance, embracing the modern "vibe coding" approach where developers describe what they want and AI handles the implementation.

## Features

- Supports up to 12 players
- Real-time game updates
- Role system for tournament play
- Spectator mode for full games
- Responsive web interface
- 100% AI-generated code

## Game Rules

1. **Basic Play:** Players must play a card of equal or higher value than the top card on the table, or skip their turn.
2. **Ace Power:** Playing an Ace clears the table and grants an extra turn.
3. **Two as Joker:** '2' cards can be played on any card and can represent any value.
4. **Same Value Skip:** Playing a card with the same value as the previous card skips the next player.
5. **Multiple Card Play:** Players can play multiple cards of the same value in a single turn.

   pip install -r requirements.txt

   ```

3. Access the game at `http://localhost:5000`
